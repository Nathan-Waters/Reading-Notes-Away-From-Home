# What Google Learned About Teams

Julia Rozovsky wanted to be a part of a compunity and the team building process and decided to attend Yale school of Managment. <br>
She mentioned that buisness school friends come from their study groups and this was not the case for her. <br>
she felt like it was more of a competition than a colaberation and that it was more scary than helpful. <br>
She found another group to join that was more focused on producing new ideas than the best idea. <br> 
her experiance with this group was much more productive and lasted for her entire time at Yale. <br>
this inspired here to get the root of what make a perfect team. <br>
she was picked up by google for Project Aristotle, a project with the goal of doing just that. <br>
they began by looking at 180 different team inside of google from a wide varity of differences. <br>
they wanted to hit as many differences as possible such as gender balance, socialization frequency in and out of work.<br>
they got 699 people an divided them up into groups and gave them different tasks. <br>
the only major take away when it comes to having a good team was that if a team did good at one task it would do good at all of them and visversa. <br>
one of the things that stuck out in the good groupd was that if everyone got a chance to talk and weigh in on the direction the team went well. <br>
The othe was based on the overal group emotional intelligence, each team members ability to know how the group as a whole is feeling and act accordingly. <br>
the rest of the article goes into an example of a former SWAT member in california used their tecqniqes as a manager at google to foster a better team.
